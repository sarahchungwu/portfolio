    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>After completing the bootcamp, I embarked on building FurEverFriend, an ongoing full stack app, to apply and deepen my understanding of the techniques learned. This project allows me to start from scratch, gaining practical experience in the entire full stack development process. With FurEverFriend, I aim to strengthen my skills and knowledge while creating a valuable and maintainable application</p>
  </div>

  <div  class="project-challenges">
    <h2>Approach and Planning</h2>
    <p>In undertaking the challenge of building a full stack app solo, I adopted a meticulous approach to ensure success. I utilized Figma to design the app's visual structure and functionality. Planning the database tables and utilizing diagrams helped establish clear relationships. To manage the project effectively, I leveraged GitHub's project issue feature, breaking down tasks into small, manageable tickets. Employing an agile methodology, I maintained separate branches for frontend and backend development, facilitating efficient Git workflow practices</p>

    <h2>Key Features and Functionality</h2>
    <p>The main features of my MVP include user authentication with Auth0 to protect user information. Users can add their dogs, match with other dogs, and communicate through messages with matched users. To develop these features, I utilized the Vite React framework for efficient development. Implementing CRUD operations, I used SuperAgent as an API to establish seamless communication between the front-end and back-end components.</p>
  </div>
  <div  class="project-challenges">
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Throughout the project, I gained valuable insights and acquired essential skills. Working independently, I learned the importance of problem-solving and troubleshooting. Breaking down tasks into smaller tickets helped me navigate the debugging process effectively. I developed a deeper understanding of CRUD operations, databases, React, and React Router. This experience reinforced the significance of continuous coding and learning, enabling me to add more features to my app and enhancing my overall development abilities</p>
  </div>

  <div  class="project-challenges">
    <h2>Future Planning</h2>
    <p>In the future, I will continue maintaining this app as an ongoing project to track my knowledge and technical skills. My goal is to build a comprehensive social app similar to Tinder, continuously adding features and improving functionality. Additionally, I plan to leverage this project as a valuable learning resource. I aim to explore different frameworks by building the same app MVP, including C#, Java, Next.js, Svelte, Rust, and Django. By working with these diverse frameworks, I will gain valuable experience and expand my skill set, fostering continuous growth and learning.</p>
