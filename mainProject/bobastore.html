    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>After graduating from boot camp, we proactively formed a team to develop Boba Buddies, an ongoing full-stack e-commerce application. This initiative serves as a hands-on lab for applying and advancing the skills we acquired. Starting from scratch, we're navigating the full spectrum of full-stack development, gaining invaluable, real-world experience. Our goal is not only to solidify our technical expertise but also to deliver a robust and sustainable platform.</p>

  <div  class="project-challenges">
    <h2>Approach and Planning</h2>
    <p>Our project was characterized by a meticulous approach and well-defined role assignments. Before commencing the project, we engaged in thorough planning, ensuring that every aspect was thoughtfully considered. Through collaborative discussions, we reached a unanimous agreement on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that we aimed to achieve. By leveraging project management tools, we optimized our workflow and facilitated efficient communication among team members. While developing the app, we maintained a focus on work-life balance. We utilized Figma as a reference to design the app, which greatly contributed to the successful execution of our project..</p><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8uKi8HNM6baetBpG8pAks4/Boba-Buddies-team-library?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=2MER3M6tkEJVR64H-0">Checkout the Figma</a>

    <h2>Key Features and Functionality</h2>
    <p>Our project's MVP boasts essential features for a seamless user experience and robust security. User authentication via Auth0 safeguards sensitive data. The platform includes an admin dashboard and an intuitive online shop. Users can effortlessly add products to cart, create wish lists, and place orders. Product pages offer insightful reviews. Admins manage orders, messages, and stock. Our development thrived with the Vite React framework, ensuring efficiency. Crucial CRUD operations empower users. SuperAgent API integration facilitates smooth front-end to back-end communication.</p>
  </div>
  <div  class="project-challenges">
    <h2>Current Progress and Ongoing Development</h2>
    <p>We're in the active phase of refining and advancing our MVP, which is a work in progress. Our team is wholeheartedly dedicated to crafting an exceptional solution that aligns with our envisioned goals.</p>
    <p>Throughout the development journey, we've encountered and conquered challenges by maintaining a balanced approach between project commitments and personal lives. Technical hurdles arising from the intricate fusion of front-end and back-end functionalities are being systematically addressed.</p>
    <p>The construction of an efficient e-commerce platform presents its own set of intricacies, but our team is navigating this with inventiveness and persistence. While the app's completion is on the horizon, our enthusiasm to deliver a comprehensive product remains steadfast. We eagerly anticipate the forthcoming development stages, where our efforts will crystallize into a successful MVP.</p>
